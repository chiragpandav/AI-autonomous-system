## Energy Domain

### Deep Agentic Analysis:
* Some aspects of this feature rely on Processed Knowledge of AI-Agents
* You can explore these functionalities by selecting any continuous feature

### Some of the available features:
Input_Pressure, Signal_Stability, Normalized_Drop, Volume_Supply, Output_Heat, Drop_Log, Steam_Level, Water_Level

If you don't want the system to perform Log Transformation, simply type: "dont do any processing" or something similar.

### Example Queries:
1. I want to see general trend of input press -- from jan to aug in 2022
2. Jan to april in 2023: I want to see line chart of Signal stability
3. can you show me stats card of Signal stability, input press and Drop Log Output Heat Entry Level system force-- from jan to april in 2023
4. i want to see stats card and line chart of Output Heat Entry Level system force -- jan to april in 2021
5. can you show me distribution of system force in 2022 jan to april?
6. i want to see histogram of Output Heat Entry Level - 15 feb to 28 March 2021
7. i want to see histogram and box plot of Output Heat Entry Level - 8 of March to end of aug 2020

9. show me trend and box plot of Output Heat Entry Level - jan to april 2020
10. dont do any processing : 8. april to 15th aug 2021: i want to see box plot for Water Level Volume supply

## AI Agentic Report

To optimize computing time and generate Agentic reports faster:
* The central knowledge base is restricted in scope.
* Interactions have been reduced for validation of generated information
* Processed knowledge is available to all agents.
* The second configuration file for modifying the behavior of all agents is not provided at this time.
* For both domains: Agentic Report generation may take up to 2 minutes
